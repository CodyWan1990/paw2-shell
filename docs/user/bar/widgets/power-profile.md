# power_profile

Shows the current power profile using a glyph. Left-click steps forward through the available profiles, right-click steps back, and scrolling does the same - all rebindable as [widget actions](../actions.md).

This widget has no settings of its own beyond the shared ones (`scale`, `enabled`, capsule styling, actions).

```toml
[widget.power_profile.actions]
scroll_up = "none"    # leave the wheel alone
scroll_down = "none"
```

**Command-line controls:**

```sh
paw2-shell msg power-set balanced
paw2-shell msg power-cycle
```

`power-set` activates a named profile such as `performance`, `balanced`, or `power-saver`. `power-cycle` switches to the next available profile and wraps to the first. See [System Controls → Power profile](../../ipc/system-controls.md#power-profile) for service requirements and command details.
